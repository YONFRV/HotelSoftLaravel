# Hotel Management System

This is a system developed in Laravel that allows the company to manage the information of the hotels it has, including basic tax data and the assignment of room types to each hotel.


## Main Features

- Hotel Entry: The system allows you to enter detailed information about the company's hotels. This includes the following data:

   - Name of the hotel
   - Address
   - Tributary information

 - Assignment of Room Types: Hotel managers can assign different room types to each hotel. The available room types are:

   - Standard
   - Junior
   - suite room

- Accommodation Validation: The system performs validations to ensure that appropriate accommodations are assigned for each room type. The rules are the following:

    - If the room type is Standard, only Single or Double accommodations are allowed.
    - If the room type is Junior, only Triple or Quadruple accommodations are allowed.
    - If the room type is Suite, Single, Double or Triple accommodations are allowed.

## Criterios de AceptaciÃ³n

The system meets the following acceptance criteria:

- Number of Configured Rooms: The system does not allow you to configure more rooms than the hotel allows.
- Unique Hotels: Duplicate hotels are not allowed in the database.
- Unique Room Types and Accommodations per Hotel: Duplicate room types or accommodations cannot be assigned to the same hotel.
- Catalog Data Management: It is not necessary to have administrators to manage catalog data such as cities, room types or accommodations. The system is responsible for maintaining this data automatically.
- Compatibility with Different Screen Sizes: The system has been designed with compatibility with different screen sizes in mind, including 15 and 13 inch laptops.
